# QA-Generation-Agent

•	Designed and implemented an end-to-end automated QA generation system for training and deploying a chatbot for students, faculty, and staff across campus, significantly enhancing information accessibility throughout the university ecosystem.
•	Devised a modular architecture featuring domain-optimized web crawling with bot detection avoidance (user-agent rotation, request delays, persistent checkpointing), semantic chunking with Named Entity Recognition (spaCy/NLTK) and key phrase extraction (TF-IDF/noun phrase detection), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation featuring cross-encoder reranking to power Large Language Models for precise, context-aware question–answer generation.
•	Engineered a Mixture of Experts architecture integrating DeepSeek R1, Llama, Flan-T5 models (XL/XXL/Large/Base), cross-encoders (ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2/L-6-v2), sentence transformers (all-mpnet-base-v2, all-MiniLM-L12-v2), and fact-checking models (vectara/hallucination_evaluation) with adaptive cascading to optimize resource utilization while boosting contextual relevance and semantic coherence in question–answer generation.
•	Achieved remarkable efficiency, generating 300 high-quality QA pairs by crawling 30 webpages in under ten minutes using an A100 GPU, demonstrating the system's production readiness and real-time capability for continuous content updates.
•	Developed sophisticated quality control mechanisms with multi-dimensional scoring (relevance, factuality, completeness, formatting) using hybrid metrics—combining n-gram overlap, semantic similarity, and specialized models for hallucination detection, toxicity classification, and Personally Identifiable Information detection—to ensure high-quality, trustworthy responses that uphold standards of fairness, privacy protection, and content inclusivity, with minimal fabrication.
•	Devised chain-of-thought prompting to produce reasoning-oriented questions requiring step-by-step analysis, thereby enhancing the chatbot’s multi-hop reasoning capabilities for university-specific inquiries (e.g., policies, resources, services).
